## The login and register page

When the application starts, It shows the login page where the user can use a social media account to use the application or sign in using credentials. This screen has also a register button for those new users that want to create a credentials account. The app logo was included to make a better-looking design:

Register page includes all necesary inputs for an account regiter gathered in the center of the screen, This makes account register more confortable. The keyboard pushes-up the imputs when it appears preventing an uncomfortable register experience.
